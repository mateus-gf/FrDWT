# Discrete Wavelet Transform using Fractional Spline Wavelets üåä

Welcome to the **FrDWT** repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of R functions to perform the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using fractional spline wavelets, covering both analysis and synthesis.

## üîç Overview

This repository includes:

- **DWT Analysis & Synthesis:** Functions to execute the Discrete Wavelet Transform using fractional spline wavelets.
- **Plotting Tools:** Visualize DWT, multiresolution analysis, and decomposition.
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Thresholding techniques
  - Wavelet confidence interval bootstrap
  - Wavelet scalogram and periodogram
  - And much more!
- There is a tutorial code serving as an example of how to perform Analysis and Syntesis using Fractional Spline Wavelets. 

These R functions are based on the original MATLAB codes by Unser and Blu:

- **Unser and Blu (1999)**
- **Unser and Blu (2000)**
- **Blu and Unser (2000)**

These R codes were utilized in the following works:

- **Pinto and Chiann (2023)**
- **Pinto and Chiann (2024)**

Please ensure to cite these references when using the functions in this repository.
